// Why a sign-in failed, for the operator: the browser only ever sees "Sign-in didn't work". One `warn` line on the

// HTTP statuses and short error codes: never a secret, code, token, state, nonce, verifier, cookie, address, name or
// other claim value. The logger caps and cleans string values, so a value can't fake another line.
